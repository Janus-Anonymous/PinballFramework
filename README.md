PinballFramework
---
Mobicom version of [TransframeworkAndroid](https://github.com/lzq8272587/TransFrameworkAndroid).

TransframeworkAndroid is __no longer__ maintained, therefore all subsequent updates are only available here.

Note
---
Together with [PinballClient](https://github.com/ymjiang/PinballClient), the PinballFramework provides Android developers with a concise and simple network request API. Moreover, it can __transparently__ handle network disruption that annoys developers who use other network frameworks such as [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) and [Volley](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley/).

Just simply put a network request and design the corresponding `onResponse` method, you can then leave it alone and wait for the magic happens without having to worry about the potential network disconnection.
